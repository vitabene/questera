#Questera

##What is it?
It is a single page task (quest) manager that is inspired by the genre of fantasy.
It is meant to gamify work that would have othewise been dull and bring a little geek fun into your daily life.

###Development stage
I work on this app in my free time and so the progress is very gradual, however, there still is *progress*, that is after all one of the things Questera is about

###Technologies used
Front-End - React for interface

Back-End - server in Go

Task runner - gulp
